Quick phishing checklist: is this email a scam?


Sender clues

    Is it from a public domain (e.g. @gmail.com) but pretending to be from a company?
    Is the domain slightly misspelled (e.g. amaz0n.com)?
    Does it differ from how that organisation normally emails you?

Content and tone

    Are there spelling or grammatical errors?
    Does it urge immediate action (e.g. “Act now”, “Your account will be closed”)?
    Is the tone inconsistent with the sender’s usual communication style?

Links and attachments

    Does the link URL differ from the anchor text?
    Is there an unexpected attachment?
    Are the call-to-action buttons vague (e.g. “Click here”, “Log in now”)?

Security pressure

    Does it ask for personal information or passwords?
    Are you asked to bypass company protocols?
    Does it threaten negative consequences if you don’t comply?

If you can answer ‘yes’ to any of these questions, do not click and always verify through a known, trusted contact method.

Let’s look at those points in more detail.

1. The sender uses a public or suspicious email domain

Legitimate organisations don’t email you from addresses like supportcompany@gmail.com.

Not even Google.

Except for some small operations, most companies will have their own email domain and email accounts. For example, genuine emails from Google will read ‘@google.com’.

If the domain name (the bit after the @ symbol) matches the apparent sender of the email, the message is probably legitimate.

By contrast, if the email comes from an address that isn’t affiliated with the apparent sender, it’s almost certainly a scam.

However, it’s not always immediately obvious that a domain isn’t legitimate: some 85% of users open emails on their smartphones, where inboxes show only names rather than email addresses.

Tip: Always tap or hover over the sender name to reveal the full address.

2. The domain name is slightly altered

There’s another clue hidden in domain names that provides a strong indication of phishing scams ­– unfortunately, it complicates our previous clue.

The problem is that anyone can buy a domain name from a registrar. And although every domain name must be unique, there are plenty of ways to create addresses that are indistinguishable from the one that’s being spoofed.

For example, in early 2025, a campaign imitating Microsoft Teams used micros0ft-teams.net and tricked users into entering their credentials on fake login portals.

These domains exploit quick-glance habits. Just one character difference can deceive even careful readers.

Remember, criminal hackers only require one mistake from one employee for their operation to be a success. Everyone in your organisation must be confident in their ability to spot a scam upon first seeing it.

3. The email is poorly written

Although phishing emails are generally better written nowadays thanks to generative AI, many still reveal themselves with misspellings and awkward phrasing.

Many scammers are from non-English-speaking countries and backgrounds where they have limited access to, or opportunity to learn, the language.

When crafting phishing messages, they’ll therefore use a spellchecker or translation machine, giving them all the right words but not necessarily in the right context.

That’s not to say any email with a mistake  is a scam, however. Everyone makes typos from time to time, especially when they’re in a hurry.

It’s the recipient’s responsibility to look at the context of the error and determine whether it’s a clue to something more sinister. You can do this by asking:

    Is it a common sign of a typo (like hitting an adjacent key)?
    Is it a mistake a native speaker shouldn’t make (grammatical incoherence, words used in the wrong context)?
    Is this email a template which should have been crafted and copy-edited?
    Is it consistent with previous messages I’ve received from this person?

If you’re in any doubt, look for other clues that we’ve listed here or contact the sender using another line of communication, whether in person, by phone, via their website, an alternative email address or through an instant message client.
4. It includes malicious attachments or links

Phishing emails come in many forms. We’ve focused on emails in this article, but you might also get scam text messages, phone calls or social media posts.

But no matter how phishing emails are delivered, they all contain a payload. This will either be an infected attachment you’re asked to download or a link to a bogus website.

The purpose of these payloads is to capture sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, phone numbers and account numbers.

Malicious links
In January 2025, scammers posed as Chase Bank with emails linking to chase-secure-login.com, stealing banking credentials from unsuspecting users.

Hover over or hold down on all links before clicking.

Infected attachments
Phishing attachments often appear as invoices or tax documents. In March 2025, an IRS-themed scam used ZIP files with embedded malware.

If you weren’t expecting a file, don’t open it. And definitely don’t enable macros unless you’ve confirmed the source.
5. The message creates urgency or fear

Scammers play on panic. The longer you think about something, the more likely you will notice things that don’t seem right. That’s why so many scams request that you act now, or else it will be too late.

Criminals know that we’re likely to drop everything if there’s apparently a problem with a critical service or if our boss emails us with a vital request – especially when other senior colleagues are supposedly waiting for us.

Some examples seen in recent months:

    “Your Google Ads will be paused in 15 minutes – confirm billing now.”
    “Internal policy breach – click here to resolve before HR escalates.”
    “Your parcel is being returned – reschedule delivery within 30 minutes.”

This tactic pushes people to act before thinking critically.














Different types of malicious emails can be classified as one of the following:

    Spam - unsolicited junk emails sent out in bulk to a large number of recipients. The more malicious variant of Spam is known as MalSpam.
    Phishing -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information. 
    Spear phishing - takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information.  
    Whaling - is similar to spear phishing, but it's targeted specifically to C-Level high-position individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.), and the objective is the same. 
    Smishing - takes phishing to mobile devices by targeting mobile users with specially crafted text messages. 
    Vishing - is similar to smishing, but instead of using text messages for the social engineering attack, the attacks are based on voice calls. 

When it comes to phishing, the modus operandi is usually the same depending on the objective of the email.
